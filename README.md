# Multithreaded Log Analyzer

## 1. Title and Overview

### Project Name: Multithreaded Log Analyzer
### Objective: 
To achieve optimal performance, develop a C++ application to parse and analyze large macOS system logs using multithreading. The application will provide insights into warnings, errors, and performance bottlenecks found in system logs.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals:
* Parse large macOS system logs efficiently.
* Process log chunks concurrently using multithreading.
* Provide actionable insights, including the most frequent warnings/errors.
* Implement a command-line interface for user interaction.

### Non-Goals:
* Development of a GUI for visual representation of results.
* Compatibility with non-macOS systems (focus is macOS-specific logs).

## 3. Design Overview
* Input: Logs fetched using the macOS log show command or a pre-existing .log file.
* Output: Summary of insights (e.g., frequency of warnings/errors, timestamp-based analysis).
* Architecture:
	* Log Reader: Parses raw logs into structured data.
	* Log Processor: Splits logs into chunks for parallel processing.
	* Aggregator: Collects and summarizes results from all threads.
	* CLI: Provides an interface for specifying log source and analysis criteria.

## 4. System Design

### 4.1 Components
* Log Reader:
	* Reads logs from a file or executes the log show command.
	* Normalizes logs into a structured format (e.g., JSON or key-value pairs).
* Log Processor:
	* Divides logs into chunks for parallel processing.
	* Processes each chunk to extract relevant data like error types and timestamps.
* Thread Pool:
	* Manages threads to avoid spawning excessive threads and ensures resource efficiency.
* Aggregator:
	* Consolidates results from each thread.
	* Output insights such as frequency distributions and anomaly detection.
* CLI Interface:
	* Allows users to specify log files, date ranges, and keywords for analysis.

### 4.2 Workflow
1.	Input Handling:
  * User specifies a log file or directs the tool to run `log show`.
2.	Preprocessing:
  * Log Reader normalizes logs.
  * Log Processor splits logs into chunks for analysis.
3.	Processing:
  * Threads process chunks concurrently.
  * Intermediate results are pushed to a shared result store.
4.	Aggregation:
  * The Aggregator compiles results into the final summary.
5.	Output:
  * Insights are displayed in the CLI.

## 5. API and Data Structures

### 5.1 Core Data Structures
* LogEntry:
```cpp
struct LogEntry {
    std::string timestamp;
    std::string level; // INFO, WARN, ERROR
    std::string message;
};
```

* ResultSummary:
```cpp
struct ResultSummary {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> frequencyByLevel;
    std::vector<std::string> frequentErrors;
    std::vector<std::string> anomalies;
};
```



### 5.2 Interfaces
* LogReader:
```cpp
std::vector<LogEntry> parseLogs(const std::string& logSource);
```

* LogProcessor:
```cpp
ResultSummary processLogs(const std::vector<LogEntry>& logs);
```

* Aggregator:
```cpp
ResultSummary aggregateResults(const std::vector<ResultSummary>& partialResults);
```
## 6. Multithreading Strategy
* Thread Pool:
  * Use a thread pool to manage worker threads and avoid overloading the system.
* Mutex for Aggregation:
  * Use std::mutex to protect shared data structures during result aggregation.
* Chunk Distribution:
  * Logs are divided into equal-sized chunks for efficient load balancing.

## 7. Testing
* Unit Testing:
  * Test each component individually (LogReader, LogProcessor).
* Performance Testing:
  * Benchmark single-threaded vs. multithreaded processing on large logs.
* Edge Cases:
  * Empty logs.
  * Logs with unusual characters or formatting.
  * Extremely large logs.
